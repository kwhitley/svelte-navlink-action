## Changelog

Until this library makes it to a production release of v1.x, **minor versions may contain breaking changes to the API**. After v1.x, semantic versioning will be honored, and breaking changes will only occur under the umbrella of a major version bump.

- **v0.1.5** - README fix by [@ivanhofer](https://github.com/ivanhofer)
